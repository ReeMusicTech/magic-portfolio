## About

Music is a powerful tool to create ambiance in spaces such as restaurants, cafes, retail stores, or gyms. However, using songs created by others involves complying with certain legal standards related to **intellectual property**. While each country has its own laws, there are some common principles you should be aware of when using music in a commercial setting.

When music is played in a venue that is open to the public—such as a restaurant or shop—it triggers the **public performance right**, which protects the creators of the work: composers, performers, and producers. It may also involve the **reproduction right** or **digital storage right** if the music is stored on a device like a computer or sound system.

These rights are often managed by **Collective Management Organizations (CMOs)**, which collect royalties on behalf of the rights holders. These organizations may charge fees even if you’re simply playing music from personal-use platforms like Spotify, YouTube, or Apple Music. **These platforms do not include commercial use rights** unless you obtain a special license. Using them in a commercial context without the proper authorization can lead to legal claims or royalty demands.

## License

**What if you create your own music using platforms like Suno or Udio?**

In recent years, artificial intelligence platforms like **Suno** and **Udio** have made it possible for anyone to generate original music. If you’re a business owner creating your own music through these tools, here’s what you should keep in mind:

1. **Copyright Status:** In many countries, works created entirely by artificial intelligence may not qualify for copyright protection, as they lack sufficient human authorship. This means such works may fall into the public domain or exist in a legal gray area, depending on the country.

2. **Commercial Use License:** Platforms like Suno or Udio often offer licenses that allow commercial use of the generated music. It’s crucial to read the **terms of service** to confirm whether you are legally allowed to use that music in your business environment without paying royalties to third parties.

3. **Legal Certainty:** While creating your own AI-generated music might seem like a practical solution to avoid copyright issues, **the legal status of AI-generated works is still evolving** in many jurisdictions. Currently, there is no global consensus on whether these works can be protected under copyright law, and often they are considered to fall into a legal gray area.

## Start

However, **this lack of legal clarity does not mean you are prohibited from using AI-generated music**. On the contrary, you are fully entitled to use such music in your establishment, especially if you created it yourself or obtained a commercial use license from the platform. We encourage you to do so—just make sure to keep a clear record of the source and terms of use.

To provide legal peace of mind, platforms like **Bido** offer curated music catalogs specifically licensed for commercial ambient use, with evidence of human intervention—so you can play music confidently and in full compliance with the law.

If any third party raises a claim over the use of that music, you will be in a stronger position to respond clearly and confidently, stating that the music is AI-generated and that no traditional rights holders are involved. **Transparency and proper documentation will be your best allies.**
