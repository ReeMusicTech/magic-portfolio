What once began as a childhood game has now become a serious, exciting, and in many cases, profitable hobby. Collecting scale model cars has gained popularity worldwide—not just for the nostalgia it evokes, but also for the value these small pieces can accumulate over time. Far from being mere toys, many models have become true collectible treasures.

## An investment that gains speed over time

Like other collectibles, scale cars can appreciate in value year after year. Well-preserved models,
especially in their original packaging and from limited editions, can increase in value by **5% to as
much as 25% annually**, depending on their rarity, demand, and condition. Some Hot Wheels from the 1960s
are now worth thousands of dollars, and newer brands are also generating interest among collector-investors.

## More than just hot Wheels

While Hot Wheels has been the entry point into collecting for many, it is far from the only brand on the
market. In recent years, other companies have emerged offering higher levels of detail, premium finishes, 
and ultra-limited editions. Brands such as **Tomica**, **Kaido House**, **Mini GT**, **Tarmac Works**, and **Ignition Model**
have raised the bar with models that flirt with perfection.

## Amalgam Collection: Automotive Art in Miniature

When it comes to excellence in scale model car making, **Amalgam Collection** is in a league of its own.
Founded in the UK, the company has earned the reputation of producing the **finest scale model cars in the world**.
With hand-crafted models officially licensed by Ferrari, Bugatti, McLaren, and others, each piece can take hundreds
of hours to complete and can sell for thousands of dollars. These are not just replicas—they are true automotive works of art.

## The Role of Technology: Collect Smarter

As collections grow, so do the challenges. How do you remember if you already own a specific model? How can you display
your collection in an organized way? How do you track the current value of each piece? The answer lies in technology.
A **specialized digital app** could help you **organize your collection with photos and tags**, **avoid duplicate purchases**,
**track real-time values**, and **share your virtual showcase with other collectors**.

In short, collecting diecast cars is no longer just a hobby—it’s an investment, an art form, and a global passion.
That’s why **we’re currently evaluating the development of an app to solve the most common pain points faced by collectors**.
If you're one of them, we’d love to hear from you and build the perfect tool to take your collection to the next level.
