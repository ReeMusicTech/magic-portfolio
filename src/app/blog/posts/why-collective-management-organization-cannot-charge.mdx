In Colombiaâ€™s music ecosystem, the public performance of musical works in commercial establishments has long been subject to charges by collective management organizations (CMOs) like SAYCO. However, a recent legal and technical review conducted by our platform, **Bido**, led to a clear and decisive conclusion: **these organizations cannot demand payment for works that are not part of their catalog**.

### What exactly happened?

Exercising our constitutional right to petition, we formally requested SAYCO to certify whether the musical works used in Bido catalog â€”original works composed and produced by our creative teamâ€” were managed, represented, or administered by the organization.

SAYCOâ€™s official response, dated June 6, 2025, was clear and categorical:

We were able to verify that there are no musical works authored by you that are represented and/or administered by this collective management society.

This means SAYCO **has no legal standing to charge for the public performance** of these works, as it holds no mandate, contract, or reciprocal agreement covering our music.

## Why is this important?

Because for years, certain CMOs have engaged in the practice of broadly charging businesses without properly verifying whether the music being used actually falls under their management. This case sets a strong precedent: **if the repertoire being used is not managed by the organization demanding payment, there is no legal basis for such charges**.

### What does this mean for businesses and music users?

* You are free to use original, non-managed music without fear of unjustified fees.
* You have the right to demand transparency regarding the repertoire being charged for.
* With technology platforms like Bido, music usage can now be tracked and verified more accurately than ever.
