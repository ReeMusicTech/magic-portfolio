title: "The Future of Background Music in the Age of AI"
summary: "As major labels negotiate deals with generative platforms like Suno and Udio, the industry shifts from confrontation to monetization. From the perspective of ambient/functional music, AI opens new possibilities for brand identity, adaptive soundscapes and democratized creation—while raising questions about rising PRO fees for music that is increasingly easy to produce."

In recent weeks, news broke about the ongoing negotiations between the major record labels —Universal, Sony, and Warner— and the generative music platforms Suno and Udio. Instead of confronting this new technology through lawsuits, as they did with Napster in the late ’90s, this time the majors seem to be choosing a different path: not resistance, but monetization. The shift is telling. It marks a new phase in the relationship between the music industry and technology—one that prioritizes capitalizing on innovation rather than fighting it.

However, from the perspective of ambient or functional music —music “created not to be listened to,” as Muzak defined it in the mid-20th century— this technological wave opens up fascinating new possibilities. Artificial intelligence doesn’t just threaten traditional models of creativity; it can also expand and personalize the way music is conceived for spaces, brands, and experiences. This is music designed to enhance environments, to influence behavior subtly, and to shape identity through sound.

For decades, background music was treated as secondary—useful, but hardly artistic. Yet now, AI allows brands to create unique sonic identities at lower costs, tailored to their aesthetics, moods, and audiences. In this field, AI is not replacing the human creator; it’s becoming a co-creative tool, enabling musicians and producers to respond more efficiently to the growing demand for personalized soundscapes.

If Muzak pioneered the idea of “functional sound” for factories and stores, today we stand at the next frontier: adaptive, intelligent sound design that evolves in real time based on context—weather, time of day, or customer behavior. The same principle remains, but technology gives it new depth and flexibility.

Still, there’s a paradox we must confront. If creating music is becoming easier, faster, and more accessible than ever, why are the performing rights organizations (PROs) charging more each year for its public use? Shouldn’t technological progress reduce the barriers between creation and access, rather than reinforce outdated collection models? Businesses that use music daily—restaurants, cafés, gyms, and retail stores—deserve to ask this question.

We are entering a time where music will be more customizable, adaptive, and identity-driven than ever before. The challenge isn’t to stop technology, but to ensure it serves creativity and fairness rather than pure speculation. If used ethically, AI could democratize sound itself—and perhaps, make the world hum to a new tune.
