History shows a clear economic pattern: when something becomes easier to produce, its cost drops and its perceived value shifts. Photography is a classic example. It once required expensive equipment, specialized knowledge, film, and development labs. Today, anyone with a smartphone can take thousands of photos instantly. The craft did not disappear, but everyday photography became abundant, inexpensive, and ultimately commoditized.

## Music is following the same path

The same transformation is happening with music. Not long ago, creating a track meant booking a studio, coordinating musicians, engineers, producers, and investing serious time and capital. Today, music can be composed, arranged, and produced with a laptop—and increasingly, with the assistance of artificial intelligence. The barriers are gone. When creation becomes fast, scalable, and accessible, music stops being scarce, and scarcity is where traditional value used to live.

## Do you really need commercial music?

This leads to a practical question for businesses: do you really need commercial music? In fashion stores, restaurants, hotels, and retail spaces, ambient music has never been designed to be actively listened to. Its role is functional, not expressive. It shapes mood, reinforces brand identity, and then fades into the background. If that is its purpose, it is worth reconsidering why brands continue to rely on costly, over-regulated catalogs. Every month you delay this decision, your competitors are already optimizing, reducing costs, and gaining more control over their sound.

## Adaptation is no longer optional

If the use of AI-supported music is legal, would your marketing department adopt it, or would you hire a prompt music engineer instead? Humans are naturally resistant to change. But the reality of today's economy is simple: if you don't adapt, you disappear—because someone else will. Curiously, several Latin American countries already show higher AI adoption rates than major economic powers, according to KPMG studies. So the question remains open: if the tools are available, legal, and already being used around you, why haven't you done it yet?

## From music ownership to music control

This is where platforms like Bido quietly redefine the conversation. When music becomes a commodity, the real value shifts from owning famous songs to controlling how sound is created, licensed, and used in your spaces. Ambient music is no longer about hits or artists—it is about efficiency, legal clarity, and alignment with your brand. In a world where music is easier than ever to make, the competitive advantage is not what you play, but how intelligently you manage it.
