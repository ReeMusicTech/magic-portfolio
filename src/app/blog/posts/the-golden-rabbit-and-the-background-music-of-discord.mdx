I must confess, with a mix of envy and perplexity, that I don’t always understand Bad Bunny. I see him there, on the Grammy stage,
with the nonchalance of someone who knows he owns the world, delivering speeches about Puerto Rican identity while the Anglo-Saxon
industry pays him tribute—perhaps out of guilt, perhaps out of pure financial calculation.

Benito Martínez has ceased to be a singer and has become a symptom. At the latest gala, his presence wasn't just musical; it was a
statement of principles. He claims to make art. His detractors say he makes noise. But the truth is that music, in this era of
infinite reproduction and Artificial Intelligence, has bifurcated: on one hand, there is music listened to with the soul; on the other,
music consumed like a Big Mac.

Is Bad Bunny art, or is he entertainment? Art, traditionally, seeks transcendence and reflective silence. Entertainment seeks
distraction and pelvic movement. Benito has achieved a perverse alchemy: packaging political grievance into a rhythm that invites
one not to think. He is the "hedonistic protester."

But let’s step into the realm of the pragmatic, where it hits our wallets. Imagine a luxury retail store, a bookstore in Madrid, or a
boutique in Soho. Would we program Bad Bunny there? This is where digital economy and copyrights collide with consumer psychology.
Putting the "Bad Rabbit" on a background playlist isn’t just an aesthetic decision; it’s a branding decision. If art is to be
contemplated and entertainment to be lived, ambient music should be for "staying."

Does Benito invite us to stay, or does he push us toward an adolescent urgency that doesn't always fit into the average transaction?
The debate is open. Perhaps the future of ambient music lies not in the charts, but in the ability to distinguish between an artist 
who doesn't distract from the buying process and a product that screams at us from the shelf.
